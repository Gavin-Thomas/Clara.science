# CLARA-AI: A Visual Mnemonic Tool for Med Students

Hey everyone,

My name is Gavin, and I'm an MS1 at the University of Calgary. Like many of you, I've found that one of the biggest challenges in med school is the sheer volume of information we need to memorize. I've always been a huge fan of visual learning tools like Sketchy, but I often wished I could have a custom mnemonic for a very specific topic or drug that wasn't covered.

That's why I built CLARA-AI (Clinical Learning through Augmented Reasoning & Art). It's a personal project born out of my own study struggles, designed to help us create memorable visual scenes for those hard-to-remember concepts, with a focus on high-yield info for exams like the MCCQE.

Think of it as a creative partner that helps you build your own visual mnemonics on the fly.

## How to Use It

The idea is pretty simple:

1.  **Enter a Topic:** In the box on the left, type in a medical concept you're trying to learn. Something like "Key features of Staphylococcus aureus" or "Mechanism of action of macrolides" works well.
2.  **Generate Scene:** Click the "Generate Scene" button. It'll take a moment for the AI to process your request, create a theme, and draw the image.
3.  **Review the Image & Key:** You'll get a custom-drawn image in the main panel. Below it, a "Mnemonic Key" will pop up, explaining what each symbol in the scene is supposed to represent.
4.  **(Optional) Edit the Scene:** If you want to add something or make a small change, use the "Edit Your Scene" box to describe the change (e.g., "Add a golden crown to the pharaoh" or "Make the character hold three axes").

## Where It Falls Short (Please Read This!)

I want to be super clear about what this tool is and isn't. It's an experiment, not a magic bullet, and it has some real limitations.

*   **It's a Supplement, Not a Replacement:** This tool is for **memorization**, not deep conceptual understanding. It's meant to help facts stick, but it's no substitute for lectures, textbooks, or UWorld. Please don't use this as your primary study resource.
*   **The AI Can Be Weird:** Sometimes the mnemonics it creates are a bit of a stretch or just plain strange. The connections might not be immediately obvious. It's a machine trying to be creative, so the results can be unpredictable.
*   **Image Generation is Imperfect:** The AI can sometimes ignore instructions. You might see a stray word or label on an image, even though I've told it a dozen times not to do that. It's a known issue with image models, and I'm always trying to improve the prompts to prevent it.
*   **MCCQE Focus is a Guideline, Not Gospel:** I've instructed the AI to focus on high-yield MCCQE content, but it's not infallible. **Always, always, always cross-reference the information with official study materials.** Don't blindly trust that what it generates is a complete or perfectly accurate representation of exam material.

## Practical Tips for Getting Good Results

*   **Be Specific, But Concise:** "Listeria monocytogenes features" is better than just "Listeria." Pasting a whole textbook chapter will likely confuse it. Find a middle ground.
*   **Use It for Rote Memorization:** This tool shines when you're trying to nail down things like bug-drug pairings, lists of side effects, or diagnostic criteriaâ€”the kind of stuff that relies heavily on pure memory.
*   **Iterate:** If you don't like the first result, try rephrasing your topic or regenerating. Sometimes a small change in the input can lead to a much better mnemonic.

I built this to help myself and hopefully to help some of you too. Hope you find it useful in your own studies.

Best,
Gavin
